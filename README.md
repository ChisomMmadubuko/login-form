# Login Form Project

## Description
This project is a responsive login form created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern design with gradient backgrounds, SVG illustrations, and client-side form validation.

## Features
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Gradient background created with Tailwind CSS
- SVG illustrations for visual appeal
- Client-side form validation for email and password
- Accessible form inputs with aria labels

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome for icons

## Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the login form.

## Usage
- Enter your email address and password in the respective fields.
- Click the "Sign in" button to submit the form.
- If there are any validation errors, you will see an alert message.
- Successful form submission will log the entered data to the console (in a real application, this would be sent to a server).

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the login form.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for form validation and submission handling.
- `assets/`: Directory containing SVG images used in the design.

## Customization
- To modify the design, edit the Tailwind classes in `index.html`.
- To change the validation logic or add more features, edit the `main.js` file.

## Future Improvements
- Implement actual server-side authentication
- Add remember me functionality
- Enhance accessibility features
- Add password strength indicator
